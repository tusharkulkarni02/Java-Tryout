The differences in output arise from how **Java**, **C++**, and **JavaScript** handle the `+` operator when used with strings and numbers. Letâ€™s analyze each case step by step.

---

### **Java:**
```java
System.out.println(" " + 5 + 3);
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`+` is Overloaded in Java:**
   - The `+` operator is overloaded for strings. If one of the operands is a string, **Java treats the entire expression as a string concatenation**.
   - `" " + 5` results in `" 5"`.
   - Then, `" 5" + 3` results in `" 53"`.

#### Output:
```
 53
```

---

### **C++:**
```cpp
std::cout << " " + 5 + 3;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Pointer Arithmetic in C++:**
   - In C++, double quotes (`" "`) represent a **string literal**, which is actually a **pointer** to the first character of the string.
   - When you do `" " + 5`, C++ treats this as pointer arithmetic:
     - `" "` points to the first character of the string.
     - `" " + 5` points 5 characters beyond the first character, which is **undefined behavior** since `" "` only has one character.

2. **Adding 3 to the Pointer:**
   - Similarly, `" " + 5 + 3` moves 3 more characters forward, resulting in an even more invalid memory location.

3. **Garbage Output:**
   - Since the program tries to print data from invalid memory, you get unpredictable garbage output, like ``.

#### Output:
```
Unpredictable (e.g., )
```

### **JavaScript:**
```javascript
console.log(" " + 5 + 5);
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Automatic Type Conversion:**
   - In JavaScript, the `+` operator behaves like string concatenation if one operand is a string.
   - `" " + 5` converts the number `5` to a string, resulting in `" 5"`.
   - `" 5" + 5` then concatenates `5` as a string, resulting in `" 55"`.

#### Output:
```
 55
```

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                | Java Behavior                                      | C++ Behavior (std::string literals)                   | JavaScript Behavior                              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **String Concatenation** | `+` is overloaded to concatenate strings and numbers | Pointer arithmetic causes unexpected behavior          | Type coercion converts numbers to strings       |
| **Type Safety**         | Strongly typed: automatic promotion only for strings | Pointer arithmetic makes behavior unsafe              | Weakly typed: converts numbers to strings       |
| **Result**              | `" 53"`                                           | Garbage output (unpredictable memory)                 | `" 55"`                                        |

### **How to Fix in C++:**
To achieve the same result in C++ (` 53` or ` 55`), use **`std::string`**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::cout << std::string(" ") + std::to_string(5) + std::to_string(3);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Output:
```
 53
```
