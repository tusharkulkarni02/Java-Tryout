       * WHAT IS THE CLASS OF PRINTLN? YOU SEE SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN IS OUT A CLASS OF PRINTLN -----> NO WRONG!

       * CORRECT ANSWER -
       *                  println() is a method of class PrintStream.
       *                  The object of PrintStream class named as out, is declared inside the class System.
       *                  Declaration of out is ===> public static final Printstream out = null;
